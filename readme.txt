Warning! This repository is very old, bulky and useless. I do not recommend using it. This was a experimental effort while learning PHP. 

Installation
1. Import the SQL file into the database.
2. Do some changes on config file.
3. Voila! You have a shitty URL shortener now! :)

Do not use this script in your production.
